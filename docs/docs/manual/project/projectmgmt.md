## Project management

You can access all of your created projects by clicking on “Open Project.” Your project list can be organized by modification date, title, row count, and other metadata you can supply (such as subject, descripton, tags, or creator). To edit the fields you see here, click “About” to the left of each project. There you can Edit a number of available fields. You can also see the project ID that corresponds to the name of the folder in your work directory.  


### Naming projects 

You may have multiple projects from the same dataset, or multiple versions from sharing a project with another person. OpenRefine automatically generates a project name from the imported file, or “clipboard” when you use Clipboard importing. Project names don’t have to be unique, so OpenRefine will create many projects with the same name unless you intervene. 

You can name a project when you create it or import it, and you can rename a project by opening it and clicking on the project name at the top of the screen. 


### Autosaving 

OpenRefine saves all of your actions (everything you can see in the Undo/Redo panel). That  includes flagging and starring rows.

It doesn’t, however, save your facets, filters, or any kind of “view” you may have in place while you work. This includes the number of rows showing, whether you are showing your data as rows or records, and any sorting or column collapsing you may have done. A good rule of thumb is: if it’s not showing in Undo/Redo, you will lose it when you leave the project workspace. 

You can only save and share facets and filters, not any other type of view. To save current facets and filters, click “Permalink.” The project will reload with a different URL, which you can then copy and save elsewhere. This permalink will save both the facets and filters you’ve set, and the settings for each one (such as sorting by count rather than by name). 


### Deleting projects

You can delete projects, which will erase the project files from the work directory on your computer. This is immediate and cannot be undone.

 

Go to “Open Project” and find the project you want to delete. Click on the X to the left of the project name. There will be a confirmation dialog. 


### Project files

You can find all of your raw project files in your work directory. They will be named according to the unique Project ID that OpenRefine has assigned them, which you can find on the “Open Project” screen, under the “About” button for each project. 

You can point OpenRefine to use another work directory using [Preferences](interface/home.md#preferences).
