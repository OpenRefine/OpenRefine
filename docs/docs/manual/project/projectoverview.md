## Overview

OpenRefine doesn’t allow you to create a dataset from nothing - you can only start a project by importing in some existing data.

No matter where you pull in data from, OpenRefine doesn’t modify your original data source. It copies all the information from your input, creates its own project file, and stores it in your [workspace directory](install/user_data.md). 

The data and all of your edits are automatically saved inside the project file. When you’re finished modifying the data, you can export it back out into the file format of your choice. 

You can also receive and open other people’s projects, or send them yours, by exporting a project archive and importing it.
