## Sort

You can temporarily sort your rows by one column. You can sort:
*   text alphabetically or reverse
*   numbers by largest or smallest
*   dates by earliest or latest
*   boolean values by false first or true first

You can also choose where to place errors and blank cells in the sorting. Text can be case-sensitive or not: cells that start with lowercase characters will appear ahead of uppercase.

After you apply sorting, you can make it permanent, remove it, reverse it, or apply a subsequent sorting. You’ll find “Sort” in the project grid header to the right of the rows-display setting, which will show all current sorting settings. 

## View

You can control what data you view in the grid. On each column, you can “collapse” that specific column, all other columns, all columns to the left, and all columns to the right. Using the “All” column’s dropdown menu, you can collapse all columns, and expand all the columns that you previously collapsed.

### Show/hide “null” 

You can also use the “All” dropdown to show and hide [“null” values](#cell-data-types). A small grey “null” will appear in each applicable cell.
