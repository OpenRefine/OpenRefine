Our user manual can be translated using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/openrefine).

## Getting access to Crowdin

You need to request access to Crowdin on [our developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrefine-dev). You will then be granted translator access on the platform.

## Publication of translations

Only the user manual for the current development version is being translated. When we publish a new stable version, we take a snapshot of this and publish it on the website.

In the meantime the pages you translate will be visible under https://docs.openrefine.org/next/ after a few days.
