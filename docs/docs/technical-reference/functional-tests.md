## Introduction

OpenRefine interface is tested with the [Cypress framework](https://www.cypress.io/).  
With Cypress, tests are performing assertions using a real browser, the same way a real user would use the software.

Cypress tests can be ran

-   using the Cypress test runner (development mode)
-   using a command line (CI/CD mode)

If you are writing tests, the Cypress test runner is good enough, and the command-line is mainly used by the CI/CD platform (Github actions)

## Cypress brief overview

Cypress operates insides a browser, it's internally using NodeJS.
That's a key difference with tools such as Selenium.

**From the Cypress documentation:**

> But what this also means is that your test code **is being evaluated inside the browser**. Test code is not evaluated in Node, or any other server side language. The **only** language we will ever support is the language of the web: JavaScript.

Good starting points with Cypress are the [Getting started guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html#Write-your-first-test), and the [Trade-offs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs.html#Permanent-trade-offs-1)

The general workflow of a Cypress test is to

-   Start a browser (yarn run cypress open)
-   Visit a URL
-   Trigger user actions
-   Assert that the DOM contains expected texts and elements using selectors

## Getting started

If this is the first time you use Cypress, it is recommended for you to get familiar with the tool.

-   [Cypress overview](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html)
-   [Cypress examples of tests and syntax](https://example.cypress.io/)

### 1. Install Cypress

You will need:

-   [Node.js 10 or 12 and above](https://nodejs.org)
-   [Yarn or NPM](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A Unix/Linux shell environment or the Windows command line

To install Cypress and dependencies, run :

```shell
cd ./main/tests/cypress
yarn install
```

### 2. Start the test runner

The test runner assumes that OpenRefine is up and running on the local machine, the tests themselves do not launch OpenRefine, nor restarts it.

Start OpenRefine with

```shell
./refine
```

Then start Cypress

```shell
yarn --cwd ./main/tests/cypress run cypress open
```

### 3. Run the existing tests

Once the test runner is up, you can choose to run one or several tests by selecting them from the interface.  
Click on one of them and the test will start.

### 4. Add your first test

-   Add a `test.spec.js` into the `main/tests/cypress/cypress/integration` folder.
-   The test is instantly available in the list
-   Click on the test
-   Start to add some code

## Tests technical documentation

### A typical test

A typical OpenRefine test starts with the following code

```javascript
it('Ensure cells are blanked down', function () {
    cy.loadAndVisitProject('food.mini')
    cy.get('.viewpanel-sorting a').contains('Sort').click()
    cy.get('.viewpanel').should('to.contain', 'Something')
})
```

The first noticeable thing about a test is the description (`Ensure cells are blanked down`), which describes what the test is doing.  
Lines usually starts with `cy.something...`, which is the main way to interact with the Cypress framework.

A few examples:

-   `cy.get('a.my-class')` will retrieve the `<a class="my-class" />` element
-   `cy.click()` will click on the element
-   eventually, `cy.should()` will perform an assertion, for example that the element contains an expected text with `cy.should('to.contains', 'my text')`

On top of that, OpenRefine contributors have added some functions for common OpenRefine interactions.
For example

-   `cy.loadAndVisitProject` will create a fresh project in OpenRefine
-   `cy.assertCellEquals` will ensure that a cell contains a given value

See below on the dedicated section 'Testing utilities'

### Testing guidelines

-   `cy.wait` should be used in the last resort scenario. It's considered a bad practice, though sometimes there is no other choice
-   Tests should remain isolated from each other. It's best to try one feature at the time
-   A test should always start with a fresh project
-   The name of the files should mirror the OpenRefine UI organization

### Testing utilities

OpenRefine contributors have added some utility methods on the top of the Cypress framework.
Those methods perform some common actions or assertions on OpenRefine, to avoid code duplication.

Utilities can be found in `cypress/support/commands.js`.

The most important utility method is `loadAndVisitProject`.  
This method will create a fresh OpenRefine project based on a dataset given as a parameter.  
The fixture parameter can be

-   An arbitrary array, the first row is for the column names, other rows are for the values  
    Use an arbitrary array **only** if the test requires some specific grid values  
    **Example:**

    ```javascript
    const fixture = [
        ['Column A', 'Column B', 'Column C'],
        ['0A', '0B', '0C'],
        ['1A', '1B', '1C'],
        ['2A', '2B', '2C'],
    ]
    cy.loadAndVisitProject(fixture)
    ```

-   A referenced dataset: `food.small` or `food.mini`  
    Most of the time, tests does not require any specific grid values  
    Use food.mini as much as possible, it loads 2 rows and very few columns in the grid  
    Use food.small if the test requires a few hundred rows in the grid

    Those datasets live in `cypress/fixtures`

### Browsers

In terms of browsers, Cypress is using what is installed on your operating system.
See the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers.html#Browsers) for a list of supported browsers

### Folder organization

Tests are located in `main/tests/cypress/cypress` folder.
The test should not use any file outside the cypress folder.

-   `/fixtures` contains CSVs and OpenRefine project files used by the tests
-   `/integration` contains the tests
-   `/plugins` contains custom plugins for the OR project
-   `/screenshots` and `/videos` contains the recording of the tests, Git ignored
-   `/support` is a custom library of assertion and common user actions, to avoid code duplication in the tests themselves

### Configuration

Cypress execution can be configured with environment variables, they can be declared at the OS level, or when running the test

Available variables are

-   OPENREFINE_URL, determine on which scheme://url:port to access OpenRefine, default to http://localhost:333

Cypress contains [exaustive documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables.html#Setting) about configuration, but here are two simple ways to configure the execution of the tests:

#### Overriding with a cypress.env.json file

This file is ignored by Git, and you can use it to configure Cypress locally

#### Command-line

You can pass variables at the command-line level

```shell
yarn --cwd ./main/tests/cypress run cypress open --env OPENREFINE_URL="http://localhost:1234"
```

## CI/CD

In CI/CD, tests are run headless, with the following command-line

```shell
./refine ui_test chrome
```

Results are displayed in the standard output
