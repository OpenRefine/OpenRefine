OpenRefine's development roadmap presents the broad directions in which the project wants to go in the coming years, based on input from user surveys and interests in the developer community. You can find the roadmap on OpenRefine's wiki: https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Roadmap

This roadmap is incomplete, is always work in progress, and is a collaborative effort of the OpenRefine community (users, developers and other stakeholders).
