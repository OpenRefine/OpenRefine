## System requirements

OpenRefine does not require internet access to run its basic functions. Once you download and install it, it runs as a small web server on your own computer, and you access that local web server by using your browser. It only requires an internet connection to import data from the web, reconcile data using a web service, or export data to the web.

OpenRefine requires three things on your computer in order to function:

#### Compatible operating system

OpenRefine is designed to work with **Windows**, **Mac**, and **Linux** operating systems. [Our team releases packages for each](https://openrefine.org/download.html).

#### Java

[Java](https://java.com/en/download/) must be installed and configured on your computer to run OpenRefine. The Mac version of OpenRefine includes Java; new in OpenRefine 3.4, there is also a Windows package with Java included.

If you install and start OpenRefine on a Windows computer without Java, it will automatically open up a browser window to the [Java downloads page](https://java.com/en/download/), and you can simply follow the instructions there.

We recommend you [download](https://java.com/en/download/) and install Java before proceeding with the OpenRefine installation.

#### Compatible browser

OpenRefine works best on browsers based on Webkit, such as:

*   Google Chrome
*   Chromium
*   Opera
*   Microsoft Edge

We are aware of some minor rendering and performance issues on other browsers such as Firefox. We don't support Internet Explorer. If you are having issues running OpenRefine, see the [section on Running](running.md#troubleshooting).

### Release versions

OpenRefine always has a [latest stable release](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/latest), as well as some more recent developments available in beta, release candidate, or [snapshot releases](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine-snapshot-releases/releases). If you are installing for the first time, we recommend [the latest stable release](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/latest).

If you wish to use an extension that is only compatible with an earlier version of OpenRefine, and do not require the latest features, you may find that [an older stable version is best for you](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases) in our list of releases. Look at later releases to see which security vulnerabilities are being fixed, in order to assess your own risk tolerance for using earlier versions. Look for ‚Äúfinal release‚Äù versions instead of ‚Äúbeta‚Äù or ‚Äúrelease candidate‚Äù versions.

#### Unstable versions

If you need a recently developed function, and are willing to risk some untested code, you can look at [the most recent items in the list](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases) and see what changes appeal to you.

‚ÄúBeta‚Äù and ‚Äúrelease candidate‚Äù versions may both have unreported bugs and are most suitable for people who are willing to help us troubleshoot these versions by [creating bug reports](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues).  

For the absolute latest development updates, see the [snapshot releases](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine-snapshot-releases/releases). These are created with every commit.

#### What‚Äôs changed

Our [latest version is OpenRefine 3.4.1](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/tag/3.4.1), released September 24th 2020. The major changes in this version are listed on the [3.4.1 release page](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/tag/3.4.1) with the downloadable packages.

You can find information about all OpenRefine versions on the [Releases page on Github](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases).

:::info Other distributions
OpenRefine may also work in other environments, such as [Chromebooks](https://gist.github.com/organisciak/3e12e5138e44a2fed75240f4a4985b4f) where Linux terminals are available. Look at our list of [Other Distributions on the Downloads page](https://openrefine.org/download.html) for other ways of running OpenRefine, and refer to our contributor community to see new environments in development.

## Installing or upgrading
### Back up your data

If you are upgrading from an older version of OpenRefine and have projects already on your computer, you should create backups of those projects before you install a new version.

First, [locate your workspace directory](#where-is-data-stored). Then copy everything you find there and paste it into a folder elsewhere on your computer.

For extra security you can [export your existing OpenRefine projects](exporting#export-a-project).

:::caution
Take note of the [extensions](#installing-extensions) you have currently installed. They may not be compatible with the upgraded version of OpenRefine. Installations can be installed in two places, so be sure to check both your workspace directory and the existing installation directory.
:::

### Install or upgrade OpenRefine

If you are upgrading an existing OpenRefine installation, you can delete the old program files and install the new files into the same space. Do not overwrite the files as some obsolete files may be left over unnecessarily.

:::caution
If you have extensions installed, do not delete the `webapp\extensions` folder where you installed them. You may wish to install extensions into the workspace directory instead of the program directory. There is no guarantee that extensions will be forward-compatible with new versions of OpenRefine, and we do not maintain extensions.

<TabItem value="win">

Once you have downloaded the `.zip` file, extract it into a folder where you wish to store program files (such as `D:\Program Files\OpenRefine`).

You can right-click on `openrefine.exe` or `refine.bat` and pin one of those programs to your Start Menu or create shortcuts for easier access.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac">

Once you have downloaded the `.dmg` file, open it and drag the OpenRefine icon onto the Applications folder icon (just like you would normally install Mac applications).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac-hb">

The quick version:

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
2. In Terminal enter ` brew cask install openrefine`
1. Then find OpenRefine in your Applications folder.

The long version:

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is a popular command-line package manager for Mac. Installing Homebrew is accomplished by pasting the installation command on the Homebrew website into a Terminal window. Once Homebrew is installed, applications like OpenRefine can be installed via a simple command. You can [install Homebrew from their website](http://brew.sh).

###### Install

Install OpenRefine with this command:

```
brew cask install openrefine
```

You should see output like this:

```
==> Downloading https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.7/openrefine-mac-2.7.dmg
########################### 100.0%
  ==> Verifying checksum for Cask openrefine
  ==> Installing Cask openrefine
  ==> Moving App 'OpenRefine.app' to '/Applications/OpenRefine.app'.
  üç∫  openrefine was successfully installed!
```

Behind the scenes, this command causes Homebrew to download the OpenRefine installer, verify the file‚Äôs authenticity (using a SHA-256 checksum), mount the disk image, copy the `OpenRefine.app` application bundle into the Applications folder, unmount the disk image, and save a copy of the installer and metadata about the installation for future use.

If an existing `OpenRefine.app` is found in the Applications folder, Homebrew will not overwrite it, so installing via Homebrew requires either deleting or renaming previously installed copies.

###### Uninstall

To uninstall OpenRefine, paste this command into the Terminal:

```
 brew cask uninstall openrefine
```

You should see output like this:

```
 ==> Removing App '/Applications/OpenRefine.app'.
```

###### Update

To update to the latest version of OpenRefine, paste this command into the Terminal:

```
 brew cask reinstall openrefine
```

You should see output like this:

```
 ==> Downloading https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.7/openrefine-mac-2.7.dmg
########################### 100.0%
  ==> Verifying checksum for Cask openrefine
  ==> Removing App '/Applications/OpenRefine.app'.
  ==> Moving App 'OpenRefine.app' to '/Applications/OpenRefine.app'.
  üç∫  openrefine was successfully installed!
```

If you had previously installed the `openrefine-dev` cask (containing a release candidate) and you want to move to the stable release, you need to first uninstall the old cask and then install the new one:

```
 brew cask uninstall openrefine-dev
 brew cask install openrefine
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux">

Once you have downloaded the `.tar.gz` file, open a shell, navigate to the folder containing the download, and type:

```
tar xzf openrefine-linux-3.4.tar.gz
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Set where data is stored

OpenRefine stores data in two places: program files in the program directory, wherever it is you‚Äôve installed it; and project files in what we call the ‚Äúworkspace directory.‚Äù You can access this folder easily from OpenRefine by going to the [home screen](running#the-home-screen) (at [http://127.0.0.1:3333/](http://127.0.0.1:3333/)) and clicking <span class="buttonLabels">Browse workspace directory</span>.

By default this is:

<Tabs
  groupId="operating-systems"
  defaultValue="win"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'}
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="win">

Depending on your version of Windows, the data is in one of these directories:
*   `%appdata%\OpenRefine`
*   `%localappdata%\OpenRefine`
*   `C:\Documents and Settings\(user id)\Local Settings\Application Data\OpenRefine`
*   `C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Roaming\OpenRefine`
*   `C:\Users\(user id)\AppData\Local\OpenRefine`
*   `C:\Users\(user id)\OpenRefine`

For older Google Refine releases, replace `OpenRefine` with `Google\Refine`.

You can change this by adding this line to the file `openrefine.l4j.ini` and specifying your desired drive and folder path:

```
-Drefine.data_dir=D:\MyDesiredFolder
```

If your folder path has spaces, use neutral quotation marks around it:

```
-Drefine.data_dir="D:\My Desired Folder"
```

If the folder does not exist, OpenRefine will create it.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac">

```
~/Library/Application Support/OpenRefine/
```

For older versions, as Google Refine:

```
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Refine/
```

Logging is to `/var/log/daemon.log` - grep for `com.google.refine.Refine`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux">

```
~/.local/share/openrefine/
```

You can change this when you run OpenRefine from the terminal, by pointing to the workspace directory through the `-d` parameter:

```
 ./refine -p 3333 -i 0.0.0.0 -m 6000M -d /My/Desired/Folder
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

---


### Logs

OpenRefine does not currently output an error log, but because the OpenRefine console window is always open (on Linux and Windows) while OpenRefine runs in your browser, you can copy information from the console if an error occurs.

Using a Mac, you can [run OpenRefine using the terminal](running#starting-and-exiting) in order to capture errors.

---

## Increasing memory allocation

OpenRefine relies on having computer memory available to it to work effectively. If you are planning to work with large datasets, you may wish to set up OpenRefine to handle it at the outset. By ‚Äúlarge‚Äù we generally mean one of the following indicators:
*   more than one million total cells
*   an input file size of more than 50 megabytes (MB)
*   more than 50 [rows per record in records mode](running#records-mode)

By default OpenRefine is set to operate with 1 gigabyte (GB) of memory (1024MB). If you feel that OpenRefine is running slowly, or you are getting ‚Äúout of memory‚Äù errors (for example, `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`), you can try allocating more memory.

A good practice is to start with no more than 50% of whatever memory is left over after the estimated usage of your operating system, to leave memory for your browser to run.

All of the settings below use a four-digit number to specify the megabytes (MB) used (actually [mebibytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte)). The default is usually 1024MB, but the new value doesn't need to be a multiple of 1024.

:::info Dealing with large datasets
If your project is big enough to need more than the default amount of memory, consider turning off <span class="fieldLabels">Parse cell text into numbers, dates, ...</span> on import. It's convenient, but less efficient than explicitly converting any columns that you need as a data type other than the default ‚Äústring‚Äù type.
:::

<Tabs
  groupId="operating-systems"
  defaultValue="win"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
    {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'}
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="win">

#### Using openrefine.exe

If you run `openrefine.exe`, you will need to edit the `openrefine.l4j.ini` file found in the program directory and edit the line

```
# max memory memory heap size
-Xmx1024M
```

The line ‚Äú-Xmx1024M‚Äù defines the amount of memory available in megabytes. Change the number ‚Äú1024‚Äù - for example, edit the line to ‚Äú-Xmx2048M‚Äù to make 2048MB [2GB] of memory available.

:::caution openrefine.exe not running?
Once you increase the memory allocation, you may find that you cannot run `openrefine.exe`. In this case, your computer needs a 64-bit version of [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml) (this is different from [Java JDK](#install-or-upgrade-java). Look for the ‚ÄúWindows Offline (64-bit)‚Äù download on the Downloads page and install that. Your system must also be set to use the 64-bit version of Java by [changing the Java configuration](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/update_runtime_settings.xml).
:::

#### Using refine.bat

On Windows, OpenRefine can also be run by using the file `refine.bat` in the program directory. If you start OpenRefine using `refine.bat`, the memory available to OpenRefine can be specified either through command line options, or through the `refine.ini` file.

To set the maximum amount of memory on the command line when using `refine.bat`, `cd` to the program directory, then type

```refine.bat /m 2048m```

where ‚Äú2048‚Äù is the maximum amount of MB that you want OpenRefine to use.

To change the default that `refine.bat` uses, edit the `refine.ini` line that reads

```REFINE_MEMORY=1024M```

Note that this file is only read if you use `refine.bat`, not `openrefine.exe`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac">

If you have downloaded the `.dmg` package and you start OpenRefine by double-clicking on it:

*   close OpenRefine
*   control-click on the OpenRefine icon (opens the contextual menu)
*   click on "show package content‚Äù (a finder window opens)
*   open the ‚ÄúContents‚Äù folder
*   open the `Info.plist` file with any text editor (like Mac's default TextEdit)
*   Change ‚Äú-Xmx1024M‚Äù into, for example, ‚Äú-Xmx2048M‚Äù or ‚Äú-Xmx8G‚Äù
*   save the file
*   restart OpenRefine.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

If you have downloaded the `.tar.gz` package and you start OpenRefine from the command line, add the ‚Äú-m xxxxM‚Äù parameter like this:
`./refine -m 2048m`

#### Setting a default

If you don't want to set this option on the command line each time, you can also set it in the `refine.ini` file. Edit the line

```
REFINE_MEMORY=1024M
```

Make sure it is not commented out (that is, that the line doesn't start with a ‚Äú#‚Äù character), and change ‚Äú1024‚Äù to a higher value. Save the file, and when you next start OpenRefine it will use this value.

## Installing extensions

Extensions have been created by our contributor community to add functionality or provide convenient shortcuts for common uses of OpenRefine. [We list extensions we know about on our downloads page](https://openrefine.org/download.html).

:::info Contributing extensions
If you‚Äôd like to create or modify an extension, [see our developer documentation here](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Documentation-For-Developers). If you‚Äôre having a problem, [use our downloads page](https://openrefine.org/download.html) to go to the extension‚Äôs page and report the issue there.
:::

### Two ways to install extensions

You can [install extensions in one of two places](#set-where-data-is-stored):

*   Into your OpenRefine program folder, so they will only be available to that version/installation of OpenRefine (meaning the extension will not run if you upgrade OpenRefine), or
*   Into your workspace, where your projects are stored, so they will be available no matter which version of OpenRefine you‚Äôre using.

We provide these options because you may wish to reinstall a given extension manually each time you upgrade OpenRefine, in order to be sure it works properly.

### Find the right place to install

If you want to install the extension into the program folder, go to your program directory and then go to `webapp\extensions` (or create it if not does not exist).

If you want to install the extension into your workspace, you can:
*   launch OpenRefine and click <span class="menuItems">Open Project</span> in the sidebar
*   At the bottom of the screen, click <span class="menuItems">Browse workspace directory</span>
*   A file-explorer or finder window will open in your workspace
*   Create a new folder called ‚Äúextensions‚Äù inside the workspace if it does not exist.

You can also [find your workspace on each operating system using these instructions](#set-where-data-is-stored).  

### Install the extension

Some extensions have their own instructions: make sure you read the documentation before you begin installing.

Some extensions may have multiple versions, to match OpenRefine versions, so be sure to choose the right release for your installation. If you have questions about compatibility or want to request or voice your support for an update, [use our downloads page](https://openrefine.org/download.html) to go to the extension‚Äôs page and report the issue there.

Generally, the installation process will be:

*   Download the extension (usually as a zip file from GitHub)
*   Extract the zip contents into the ‚Äúextensions‚Äù directory, making sure all the contents go into one folder with the name of the extension
*   Start (or restart) OpenRefine.

To confirm that installation was a success, follow the instructions provided by the extension. Each extension will appear in its own way inside the OpenRefine interface. Make sure you read its documentation to know where the functionality will appear, such as under specific dropdown menus.
