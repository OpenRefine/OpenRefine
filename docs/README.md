How to build these docs
=======================

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for our docs. Assuming you have NPM installed, you can install Docusaurus with:

```
npm install
```

Once this is done, generate the docs with `npm run build`.

You can also spin a local web server to serve the docs for you, with auto-refresh when you edit the source files, with:
```
npm start
```
