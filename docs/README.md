How to build these docs
=======================

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for our docs. Assuming you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed (which includes npm), you can install Docusaurus with:

```
cd docs
npm install
```

Once this is done, generate the docs with:
```
npm run build
```

You can also spin a local web server to serve the docs for you, with auto-refresh when you edit the source files, with:
```
npm start
```
