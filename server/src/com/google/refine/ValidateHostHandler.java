     * Matching is a little fuzzy to simplify the regular expression - it expects the Host

     *  - 127.6..64.245
     *  - 0::0:::0:00:1
     * This is not a problem however, as these are not valid DNS names either, and should
     * never be sent by a well-behaved browser - and validating the host header only ever
     * helps if the browser works as expected and cannot be used to fake the Host header.
