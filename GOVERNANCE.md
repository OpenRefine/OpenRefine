# OpenRefine Governance Model 

## Summary / Overview 
OpenRefine is a free, open-source, powerful tool for working with messy data. OpenRefine has a plugin architecture and is distributed under the [new BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) allowing modification, distribution and name changes. 

## Roles And Responsibilities
OpenRefine development is based on user consensus and open discussion between users. Decision making must be done in a transparent, open fashion (ie. using discussion list and issue list). No decisions about the project’s direction, bug fixes or features may be done in private without community involvement and participation. Discussions must begin at the earliest possible point on a topic; the community’s participation is vital during the entire decision-making process.

Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design, and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that participation takes place.

### Users
Users are community members who have a need for the project. Through their usage, they give the project a purpose. Users are encouraged to participate in the project life by providing feedback on how their needs are satisfied. 

Users activities include (but are not limited to):

- Evangelisation and advocating for the project
- Informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective through the [user discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine) or the [issue list](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues?state=open)
- Providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
- Writing tutorials
- Making a financial contribution to OpenRefine //TO DO add link

## Code For Science and Society 

Since January 2020, OpenRefine is a member project of the Code For Science and Society (CS&S). 

CS&S provides administrative and fiscal infrastructure to receive and manage funds under CS&S Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement. CS&S is a USA based organization qualified as exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and classified as a public charity under IRC Sections 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(vi). 

### Manage Funds 

While the vast majority of OpenRefine contributors are volunteers, we recognize the need to attract and retain contributors to help:
- perform time critical maintenance tasks for the project (for example release management, security update, pull request review and comments)
- address issues that will not be naturally done by the community (for example documentation or working on large or long term projects)

CS&S currently manages the current funding sources: 
- **Grants**: Funds are allocated based on the grants requirements. Grants help to secure resources to achieve long term goal or supports software maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement.
- **Google Summer of Code**: Google Summer of Code mentors are eligible for USD 500 compensation for their work. 
- **Donations made through GitHub Sponsors or made directly to CS&S on behalf of OpenRefine**: Decisions on usage of funds is made by the Advisory committee with guidance from Organization Members. 

Combined with CS&S, the Steering and Advisory committees have experience applying and managing grants. If you are interested in applying to a grant to improve OpenRefine, please share your idea early on the Developer mailing list. It will be a pleasure helping you through your grant application. New grants must be approved by the Advisory Committee. that CS&S retains a 15% handling fees on any donation to finance their operations (20% for government funding).
