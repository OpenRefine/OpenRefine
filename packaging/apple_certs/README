Apple distribution certificates
===============================

Those certificates are used to code-sign OpenRefine binaries.
They are decoded in the CI using the embedded GPG key.

The libjffi-1.2.jnilib file is a version of a shared library recompiled by us using a newer Xcode SDK so that it can be signed.
This is a temporary measure until this is fixed upstream:
