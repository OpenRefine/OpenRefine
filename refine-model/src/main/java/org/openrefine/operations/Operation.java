/**
 * An operation represents one step in a cleaning workflow in Refine. It applies to a single project by creating a
 * {@link Change}, which is stored in the {@link org.openrefine.history.History} by an
 * {@link org.openrefine.history.HistoryEntry}.
 * 
 * Operations only store the metadata for the transformation step. They are required to be serializable and
 * deserializable in JSON with Jackson, and the corresponding JSON object is shown in the JSON export of a workflow.
 * Therefore, the JSON serialization is expected to be stable and deserialization should be backwards-compatible.
 * 
 * Operations are reproducible, in the sense that they represent transformation steps which can be meaningfully
 * reapplied in another context. For instance, editing a single cell at a specified row and column is not reproducible
 * (in the sense that it relies on a specific version of the dataset, rather than any dataset with a given schema).
